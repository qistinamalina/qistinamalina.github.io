                <h3>Secretary Club of Pandu Puteri (Girl Guides Association Malaysia)</h3>
                <p>2019<br>
                    As secretary Club i spend a considerable amount of my time planning logistics for groups of students. 
                    Since these clubs consist of several team members, one of the most crucial 
                    things i learn is how to delegate effectively.
                    As a club member, i'll get to hone, fundraising, organizational, and communication skills.</p>

                <h3>Art</h3>
                <p>2015-2019<br>
                    Being involved in music activity allows me to think outside the box, become flexible, develop empathy, 
                    and improve my observation skills. Performing arts also goes a long way in 
                    improving my communication and public speaking skills.</p>
